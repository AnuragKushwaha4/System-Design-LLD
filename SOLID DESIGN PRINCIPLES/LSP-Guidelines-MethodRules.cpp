/*
Method rules are the Guideline to ensure LSP properly implemented as a name suggest that it is
 related to methods of a class--> it is basically a condition that a method must 
 satisfy.... it is of tow types:
PreConditioned and postCondition.

Precondition --- In this a method should follow a specific condition before implementations so its 
child that overriding that functionality must also follow that same condition or must follow more 
strengthern condition...
PostCondition--- In this a method should follow a specific condition after implementations so its 
child that overriding that functionality must also follow that same condition or must follow more 
weaker condition...
